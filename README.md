# Partify

A Spotify-powered app that enables users to create and host parties where multiple users can add to a singular queue. Built with React Native, Node.js, Socket.io, MongoDB, and Spotify's Native SDKs.

## How it works

Users can specify whether they want to "host" a party or "crash" a party. If they choose host, they will be given a code which they can distribute to their friends, who can join the party. Once the host and their friends are logged in, they will be able to search for songs, artists, and albums, and add songs to the shared queue. Note that only the host can control playback and skipping songs, clients can only add songs to the queue.

## How to test it

Clone the repo, cd into myapp, and build the project! The server is hosted on Heroku, so no setup is required.
